TERRAFORM VARIABLES
---
Variables: You must define input values when you want to execute Terraform configuration code.
  Syntax: <argument name> = var.<variable name>
  Don't forget to declare the variable in any file ending with .tf, but typically in a variables.tf file or a .tfvars file!
  If your config is small, you coude perhaps define it in any file, include main.tf
