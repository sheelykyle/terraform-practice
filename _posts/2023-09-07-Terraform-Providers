TERRAFORM PROVIDERS
---
Provider: an executable plugin which defines the version, auth details, etc for reaching out to a specific cloud service (ex. AWS).
Downloaded when you run "terraform init"

(Terraform Registry is the main directory of publicly available Terraform providers and hosts providers for most major infra platforms).
More info for AWS can be found here: https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest

Best practice: to place this info in a file named "providers.tf"

ALIAS
If you need to override the default provider's config for a resource, you can create an alternative provider with alias. (ex. having an alias for a different region)

Example:

provider "aws" {
  region    = "us-east-1"
}

provider "aws" {
  alias     = "europe"
  region    = "europe-west-1"
}
